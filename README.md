If you already have subnets created with appropriate networking, you can supply their IDs as a list in the variables `aws_vpc_id`, `eks_subnets_public` and (optionally) `eks_subnets_private`.  In that case routing tables, security group rules and gateways, along with the associations between them, will *not* be created in the supplied subnets.
